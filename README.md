# bookShopFinder
In this project, I would try to develop a .txt file matcher.

My gold it it to create a functional word-manager to admin books in a bookshop

Tasks:

1) Count words
2) Detect non language words and mark them as 'special words' (tag on process xD)
3) Detect words with a irregular use (that appears just a few times) and mark it as 'expresional words' (also in process xD)
4) Compare this 'expresional words' with a database of all the 'expresional words' on the bookshop.
   with this method, we wold be able to fin books with simmilar use of wods.
   Obiosly this will need a 'calibration' on the percentage of words needed to match whit a ral similar book. 
   Maybe a 'prepositions' seccion to be more specific in the matching, or some other literal resources
